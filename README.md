Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI | C++
A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where the player competes against an unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm. This project showcases recursive decision-making, game state evaluation, and clean terminal interaction using C++.

Features:
•	- Implements the Minimax algorithm to make the AI unbeatable.
•	- Turn-based gameplay between player (X) and AI (O).
•	- Detects win, draw, and invalid inputs.
•	- Uses a 3x3 grid displayed in the console.

Key Concepts Used:
•	- C++ arrays and condition checking.
•	- Recursion and backtracking (Minimax).
•	- Game logic and state management.
•	- Basic CLI-based user interface.

How to Run:
1. Compile using any C++ compiler:
   g++ main.cpp -o tictactoe
2. Run the game:
   ./tictactoe
Example:
Current board:
 1 | 2 | 3
---|---|---
 4 | 5 | 6
---|---|---
 7 | 8 | 9

Enter your move (1-9): 5
...
AI wins!
